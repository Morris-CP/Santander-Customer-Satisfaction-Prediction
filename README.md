# Santander Customer Satisfaction Prediction
Binary Classification｜Feature Engineering｜Imbalanced Data｜Production-Level Tabular ML

This project is based on the classic Kaggle competition **Santander Customer Transaction Prediction**. The goal is to predict whether a user will perform a specific transaction behavior using a highly anonymized dataset of numerical features.  

Tech Pipeline：
Data preprocessing: cleaning, sparse feature removal
Feature engineering: statistical & interaction features
Model training: LightGBM with cross-validation
Model explainability using SHAP
AUC results and interpretation plots
